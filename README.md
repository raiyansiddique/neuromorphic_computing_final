The goal of this project is to explore and design two fundamental components of neuromorphic comput- ing, the neuron and the synapse. Although there were many synapse and neuron designs researched, for the purposes of implementation we chose a Leaky Integration and Fire Neuron paired with a mem- ristor emulator or Current Multiplier Charge Injector (CMCI) Synapse. LIF Neurons were chosen because they are the most common neuron used for high frequency high efficiency architectures. The CMCI synapse was chose to show integration with digital training schemes. The memristor emulator was chosen as it is the best way to simulate a memristor, which is where the field is heading in terms of synapse design.
